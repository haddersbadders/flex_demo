# Flex demo

This is a demo of the Flex CSS property. You can see the live page here:

Flex or Flexbox is a really nice way to deal with CSS positioning. 

See [https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) for a full explanation. 

## My example 

My example is really simple. To do flex, you need to put items inside a containing element. I have a DIV with a class name *container*:

```
<div class="container">

</div>
```
The only CSS property this element needs is: 

```
.container {
  display: flex;
  }
```
